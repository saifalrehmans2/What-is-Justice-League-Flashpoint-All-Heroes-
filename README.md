Justice League: Flashpoint – All Heroes

The Justice League: Flashpoint storyline is one of the most pivotal and transformative arcs in the DC Universe, shaking the foundations of reality itself. At the heart of this narrative is Barry Allen, the Flash, who wakes up in an alternate timeline where the world is on the brink of destruction. This world is drastically different from the one he knows, with key heroes acting in ways that are both unfamiliar and disturbing. In this altered reality, the Justice League is fractured, alliances are broken, and the fate of the world is uncertain.

The plot begins when Barry Allen wakes up and realizes that things are not as they should be. He still possesses the speed force, but his life has changed in ways that he cannot fully comprehend. He has no memory of how the world arrived at this critical juncture. The first major revelation is that the Justice League does not exist in this reality, and without their intervention, the world is descending into chaos.

1. The Flash (Barry Allen)
Barry Allen is the protagonist of this tale, but in this timeline, he is not the beloved hero we know. Instead, he’s an ordinary man who never became the Flash. In this alternate world, his mother, Nora Allen, was never killed, and Barry’s life is much different. However, the absence of his mother’s death has profound consequences. Barry is unaware of how his speed powers have manifested in this reality, but when he discovers his abilities, he quickly realizes he must fight to restore the timeline.

Barry’s journey is fraught with moral dilemmas as he discovers the consequences of changing history. He ultimately seeks the help of his alternate universe counterparts, all of whom are vastly different from the versions he knows. His quest to fix the timeline is central to the plot, and it’s through his actions that the fate of the universe will be decided.

2. Batman (Thomas Wayne)
In this reality, Bruce Wayne was not the one to become Batman. Instead, his father, Thomas Wayne, dons the cape and cowl. After the death of his son, Bruce Wayne, in a mugging gone wrong, Thomas became a darker, more violent version of Batman. He operates without the moral compass of his son and is willing to use lethal force to punish criminals. This version of Batman is not only physically imposing but emotionally scarred, having lost the light of his life.

Thomas Wayne’s relationship with his son in this timeline is deeply tragic. While he seeks to stop crime in Gotham, he is a man driven by revenge and a desire to bring justice at any cost. He becomes an unlikely ally to Barry as they both seek to undo the cataclysmic events unfolding. However, Thomas’ sense of justice is far more brutal than Barry’s, creating an interesting dynamic between the two.

3. Wonder Woman (Diana of Themyscira)
Wonder Woman in this alternate timeline is not the warrior for peace that fans know. Instead, she is at war with Aquaman and his Atlantean forces. The conflict between the Amazons and Atlanteans has escalated into a full-scale war that threatens the stability of the entire world. Wonder Woman leads the Amazon forces with ferocity, showing little mercy for those who oppose her.

In this version, Diana’s relationships are marked by violent passions. She is romantically involved with Aquaman’s archenemy, and the rivalry between the two factions escalates, causing untold destruction across Europe. Wonder Woman’s motivations, while initially grounded in her love for her people and her desire to protect them, become clouded by the constant battles. She becomes a central figure in the conflict, forcing Barry to reconsider his mission when the scope of the war becomes clear.

4. Aquaman (Arthur Curry)
In this world, Aquaman is the king of Atlantis and a major antagonist to Wonder Woman. His aggression towards the Amazons is rooted in a desire for vengeance after a series of betrayals, making him one of the most dangerous men on the planet. Arthur Curry, unlike his heroic counterpart, is a ruthless ruler who commands his underwater kingdom with an iron fist. His romantic relationship with Mera is strained by the ongoing war, which further complicates his character.

As the war between the Atlanteans and the Amazons rages on, Arthur’s brutal tactics escalate, and he uses his vast resources to launch a devastating series of attacks on the surface world. His actions push the planet closer to the brink of total annihilation, with the damage threatening both land and sea. Aquaman’s transformation into a warlord in this timeline presents a tragic divergence from the heroic figure of the traditional Justice League.

5. Cyborg (Victor Stone)
Cyborg, in this alternate timeline, plays a pivotal role, but he is a far cry from the hero he is known to be. Instead of being a member of the Justice League, Cyborg is a weapon of the United States government. As a part of a covert military project, Victor Stone is forcibly enhanced with cybernetic technology, transforming him into a living weapon rather than the hero he once hoped to be. His body, now more machine than man, symbolizes the loss of his humanity, and he becomes entangled in the military-industrial complex.

Cyborg’s character arc in Flashpoint is a tragic one. His transformation into a cold, emotionless soldier represents the corruption of his potential. The character’s role is deeply ironic, as he is a tool used by the government, and his sense of identity has been erased. Despite this, he still retains a sense of justice, which ultimately leads him to question his role in the war and his alliance with other powerful figures like Batman and Wonder Woman.

6. Superman (Kal-El)
In the Flashpoint timeline, Superman is a captive of the government and has never been raised by the Kents. Instead of growing up in Smallville, Clark Kent’s spaceship was intercepted, and he was imprisoned by the U.S. government. As a result, Superman is not the iconic hero fans know; he is a pale, weakened version of himself, having spent his entire life in a government facility where he is experimented on. Deprived of sunlight and unable to fully access his powers, this version of Superman is an emotional and physical shell of the hero he could have been.

Barry seeks out this version of Superman, hoping that he might be able to tap into the hero’s strength and sense of hope to help him restore the timeline. The contrast between this broken Superman and the fully realized Superman from the main timeline is stark and emotional, highlighting the profound impact the Flashpoint event has had on the world.

7. Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne)
The antagonist of Flashpoint is none other than Reverse-Flash, Eobard Thawne, who has manipulated the timeline for his own gain. In this reality, Reverse-Flash’s machinations have caused the world to spiral into chaos. His ultimate goal is to ensure that Barry Allen never becomes the Flash and that his own power continues to grow unchecked. He is the architect of this broken reality, and his role as the villain is central to the story’s resolution.

Thawne’s rivalry with Barry Allen is personal, and his deep hatred for the Flash makes him a dangerous adversary. He will stop at nothing to keep Barry from undoing the changes he has made to the timeline.

Conclusion
Flashpoint introduces a world of chaos, where the heroes we know and love are twisted by tragic circumstances. As Barry Allen attempts to restore the timeline and fix the fractured world, he must confront these dark versions of familiar characters, learning painful lessons along the way. The story not only highlights the fragility of the universe but also emphasizes the importance of choice, sacrifice, and heroism. Through the struggles of these iconic characters, Flashpoint serves as a reminder of how easily things can go awry and how every action, no matter how small, can have immense consequences.
